I have recently obtained my Ph.D. degree in Mathematics (with a specialization in Statistics) from the Department of Mathematics at the University of California, San Diego, under the direction of Professor Jelena Bradic. I received my bachelor's degree from the School of Mathematics and Statistics at Wuhan University in 2016. 

I will join the Institute of Statistics and Big Data at the Renmin University of China as an Assistant Professor in 2022.

My research focuses on theory and methodology in causal inference, missing data problems, semi-supervised inference, high-dimensional statistics, and machine learning.
